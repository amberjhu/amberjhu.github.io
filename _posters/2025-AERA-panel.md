excerpt: 'Why does education need artificial intelligence (AI), and what does AI mean for educational justice? While optimism surrounds the growing use of AI in education, we challenge this uncritical embrace. As yet, education researchers have not fully examined the potential and documented harms AI posesâ€”particularly to minoritized students, their schools, and communities. This presidential session aims to open a research-based dialogue on the risks and potential benefits of AI in education, given what our limited evidence tells us thus far. Framed through a lens of rigorous skepticism, we question whether AI is truly necessary for advancing education or educational justice. We will explore both the well-documented harms from interdisciplinary research and engage in thoughtful speculation about future risks.'
