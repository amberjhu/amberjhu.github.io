excerpt: 'As demand for K-12 computer science (CS) education grows, we
argue that most students would be best served by CS classes that
not only teach computational thinking/programming, but also chal-
lenge them to critically analyze the role of technology in society.
One of the main barriers to implementing this in K-12 classrooms
is a lack of research on how in-service CS teachers can integrate
critical pedagogy into their school context and existing curricula.
This poster presents results from a study to co-design lessons with
current K-12 CS teachers to integrate critical perspectives into their
classrooms. Teacher participants participated in a synchronous pro-
fessional learning series in which we taught them critical computing
content drawn from relevant books and frameworks. Following this,
we collaborated with the teacher participants to design or modify
lessons that engage their students in critical analysis, which the
participants then implemented in their classrooms. Teachers were
encouraged to include content relevant to their students and the
communities they are a part of. We conducted thematic analysis of
transcripts from the interviews, professional learning series, and
co-design sessions. The resulting eight (8) themes demonstrate the
challenges and opportunities inherent in integrating critical per-
spectives into K-12 computing education. In the long term, results
from this work will inform future sociocultural content integration
into K-12 CS courses (e.g. "ethics content").'
